# FoodPricesMonitoring
This project contains a pipeline that fetches food prices from markets around Kenya, transforms, loads the data into a PostgreSQL database and visualizes the data in Grafana Cloud. The pipeline is automated to run on a weekly basis for the API and monthly for the CSV/JSON files
